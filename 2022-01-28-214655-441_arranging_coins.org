* Description
You have ~n~ coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins.
The staircase consists of ~k~ rows where the ~ith~ row has exactly ~i~ coins.
The last row of the staircase *may be* incomplete.

Given the integer ~n~, return /the number of *complete rows* of the staircase case you will build/.

Constraints:
$1 \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1$

** Examples:

#+caption: 441 Arranging Coins example
#+begin_example
1
11
11

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.


1
11
111
11

Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
